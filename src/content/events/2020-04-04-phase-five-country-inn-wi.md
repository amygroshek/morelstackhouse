instructor_bio: "<p>Lynne is a Registered Instructor with the Society of Ortho-Bionomy InternationalÂ®.</p><p>In 2001, Lynne fell down a flight of stairs and herniated her L5/S1 disk in her spine.  After 9 months of physical therapy, dietary changes and Alexander technique, she realized she was only 50% better.  At this time she began her search for a solution to her pain and through a friend was introduced to Ortho-Bionomy.  After one session with Morel Stackhouse, Lynne walked  away without any pain or obvious limp.  This experience opened her eyes to a more subtle, pain-free way to help her body heal.  One month after the session, she began her studies in Ortho-Bionomy.</p><p>Ten years prior to her studying Ortho-Bionomy, she taught a subtle form of movement as an International Master Teacher of Callanetics.  Lynne was deeply influenced by her experience of teaching and training Callanetics which helped her realize that she has a unique point of view of the human body.  She brings this perspective and experience into her teaching of Ortho-Bionomy, as well as her daily private practice. Lynne has been actively practicing Ortho-Bionomy since 2003 in her hometown of Leonia, New Jersey.</p><p>During her studies of Ortho-Bionomy, she was fortunate to have learned from many instructors throughout the Ortho-Bionomy community.  Her main influences were Morel Stackhouse, Ursula Hofer and Darlene Smith.</p><p>Currently, Lynne is in training to become an Advanced Instructor of Ortho-Bionomy and is a member of the N.Y.C. OB-Lab.</p>"
excerpt: "The focus of Phase Five is to move to a more subtle level of awareness of the practice and principle of Ortho-Bionomy. Specific techniques develop and increase the student's understanding and proprioceptive sensitivity to the self-corrective movements initiated by the client. Through the practice of observing, following and supporting subtle movement patterns, muscular tension is released, range of motion is increased and pain is reduced. In Phase Five, students are encouraged to do less and let the client be the guide for his/her exploration of change."
