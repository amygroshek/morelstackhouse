testimonials: 
 - I feel much better equipped to address the pelvis with detail that makes a difference.
 - As Ortho‐Bionomy principles become more familiar, what I learn is to the point and profound. I like the atmosphere of exploring together as we clarify the techniques.
 - I so loved this class and the material. This was a ‘Master Class’.
 - Morel is brilliant. Most of this course was developed in her Ortho‐Bionomy practice. Awesome!
excerpt: "Advanced Phase Four Spine & Pelvis is a continuation of Phase Four Ortho‐Bionomy Fundamentals: Spine & Pelvis. In this class you will observe and practice specific techniques for releasing imbalances of the pubic bone, coccyx, hemi pelvis, femoral/coxal joint, facet joints, and muscles of the back and pelvis. You will also learn techniques for working with the spines of people with scoliosis and people who have undergone spinal fusions. These techniques result in the release of pain and neuromuscular tension patterns and promote an expanded range of motion, increased circulation and a greater sense of well being. "
