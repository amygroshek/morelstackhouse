excerpt: "Ortho-Bionomy: Exploration of Movement Patterns adds depth and dimension to Phase Four Ortho-Bionomy, moving it from technique to art. In this class you will learn to observe and explore various patterns of movement throughout the body in skin, fascia, muscle, connective tissue, bone, nerves, and fluid. We will use movement as both a means of assessment and as a release technique. Bodies are designed to move - releasing them through the application of movement deepens the connection between form and function, integrates the releases with the rest of the system, and gives the body a deeply-felt experience of itself. These techniques form an excellent bridge from the physical to the energetic work of Ortho-Bionomy."
