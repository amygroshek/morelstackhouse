### Course Description

Ortho-Bionomy Fundamentals: Extremities covers the history, philosophy and basic concepts of Ortho-Bionomy. In this class you will observe and practice specific techniques for releasing imbalances of the shoulder girdle, arm, elbow, wrist and hand; hip, leg, knee, ankle and foot. These techniques result in the release of pain and neuromuscular tension patterns, promoting expanded range of motion, increased circulation and a greater sense of well-being.

Ortho-Bionomy techniques are highly effective, easy to learn, easy on your body, and combine well with other bodywork and complimentary healing systems. You will discover ways to:

 - Help relieve pain gently, without causing pain
 - Work with common problems of the extremities
 - Release sensitive (trigger) points with little or no effort
 - Experience and understand the natural reflexes of the body
 - Develop your sensitivity to the subtle, structural changes that promote healing
