In addition, our posture holds the potential for everything we can become. These habits of use have a profound affect on patterns of musculoskeletal tension within the body. In this class we will explore various postural patterns and their affect on spinal balance."

### Course Description

Posture is how we live in our bodies - the sum total of everything that has happened during our lives and how we felt about it. In addition, our posture holds the potential for everything we can become. These habits of use have a profound affect on patterns of musculoskeletal tension within the body. In this class we will explore various postural patterns and their affect on spinal balance. You will learn:

 - Techniques and exercises for promoting balanced posture within your own body, as well as for working with clients.
 - Techniques to work with spinal curvatures and scoliosis.
 - Post-techniques for the pelvis, spine and ribcage. Post Techniques exercise the spine and the intervertebral disks. They can be used for both assessment and release, as well as integration of the work done in a session.

"If you donâ€™t work with your clients posture, they will never get better"  
~ Arthur Lincoln Pauls, D.O., Founder of Ortho-Bionomy
