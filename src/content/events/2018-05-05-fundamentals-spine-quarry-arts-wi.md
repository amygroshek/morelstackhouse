### Course Description

This course covers the history, philosophy and basic concepts of Ortho-Bionomy. In this class you will observe and practice specific techniques for releasing imbalances in the neck, thoracic spine and ribcage, lumbar spine, pelvic girdle and sacrum. These techniques result in the release of pain and neuromuscular tension patterns, promoting expanded range of motion, increased circulation and a greater sense of well-being.

Ortho-Bionomy techniques are highly effective, easy to learn, easy on your body, and combine well with other bodywork and complimentary healing systems. You will discover ways to:

 - Help relieve pain gently, without causing pain
 - Work with common problems such as whiplash injuries, low back pain, and sciatica
 - Release sensitive (trigger) points with little or no effort
 - Experience and understand the natural reflexes in the body
 - Develop your sensitivity to the subtle, structural changes that promote healing
