### Course Description

This study group will review the Biological Model of Trauma, how trauma affects people, and how practitioners of therapeutic bodywork can most effectively work with individuals who are affected by trauma. Participants will learn about the neurological basis of trauma in the autonomic nervous system and how to recognize signs of trauma in their clients. We will explore Trauma Resourcing in depth: specific verbal and energetic approaches as well as bodywork techniques for working with trauma-based dysfunction in the body.
